; NOTICE: InGameScreenCoord are NOT resolution, but a system that game uses itself to later scale it to actual shown viewport, you should most likely not change those
; ScreenPosition - set viewport position for generated bars, should be set to match top-left corner, AutoPositionSetup shall try to set it autamatically
; GameToScreenScaling - scaling between game to screen viewports, should be set to match scale between InGameScreenCoord and shown screen , AutoGameToScreenScaling shall try to set it autamatically
; AutoPositionSetup and AutoGameToScreenScaling - by default you want it to work by itself, if it won't work, try to activate OffsetTest to dedect values by yourself and turn off those options accordingly

; UseStaminaForNPC - changes posture bar to stamina bar for all human characters, while they have stagger values, they do not use them at all
; BarWidth and BarHeight - uses in game scaling (1920x1080)
; ResetStaggerTotalTime - when enemy crosses 0 value of posture damage, they automatically restore it to full while getting posture broken, this value sets arbitrary time for animation of bar to load itself to full
; FirstBossScreen - sets coords (in game scaling) of first boss posture bar, right now it is found by setting value til you are satisfied with it's location, use OffsetTest to help you with finding that offset
; NextBossBarDiffScreenY - seets coords (in game scaling) for next boss bar Y wise (multiple boss fights)
; NOTICE: Some mods can change this offset (like reforged), which means you will have to find it by yourself. Some popular offsets: Default (x: 963 y: 863), Reforged (x: 963 y: 945)

; OffsetTest - creats in game menu for adjusting screen and bar offsets. Use "Insert" key to save currently modified offset to .ini. Use "Page up/down" keys to change which offset you want to modify. Use "Arrows" keys to modify values.
